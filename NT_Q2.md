# SOP for joining the Artficial Intelligence Communiy
## **Goals and Motivation**
My primary motivation for joining the Artificial Intelligence (AI) community stems from a deep curiosity about how intelligent systems function and their transformative impact on society. AI is revolutionizing every domain in today's world which makes it an extremely useful skill to learn. As someone at the beginning of this journey, I am eager to understand the fundamental principles that power these AI models and learn how to build solutions that can make a real-world impact. My goal is to develop a strong foundational understanding of AI and Machine Learning (ML) and eventually contribute to industry projects that use AI models for social good. 

## **Relevant Background and Knowledge**
Although I am a newcomer to the field of AI and ML, I have a solid grounding in programming fundamentals and bit of mathematics(not a hardcore math fan tho) :). I am currently familiarizing myslef with Python, as it is clearly a widely used language in AI development. I have also begun exploring beginner-friendly online courses on youtube and tutorials to gain an initial understanding of topics like supervised learning, neural networks, and natural language processing. Though my experience is pretty limited, I am a fast learner and comfortable working through challenging material independently or collaboratively. This assignment gave me a pretty nice motivation to learn so many new concepts in a few days, the feeling of seeing a neural network run and seeing it give actual results was pretty good, it wasn't like I built it from scratch but seeing how it runs seemed pleasing to the eyes.

## **Contribution and Learning Objectives**
As a beginner, I hope to bring a fresh perspective, enthusiasm, and a strong willingness to learn in the AI community. I am particularly interested in contributing to open-source projects, and participating in workshops or hackathons that foster collaborative learning. Hackathon is something i really want to experience once, it is a completely new thing to me, that was also one of the reason i couldn't do the non-technical question 1 which was based on hackathon. I believe that asking thoughtful questions, learning along with like minded peers can be valuable contributions at this early stage.

Through active participation in the community, I aim to deepen my conceptual understanding, gain hands-on experience, and stay updated with current trends and breakthroughs in the field. I also hope to build connections with like-minded peers and mentors who can guide me along the way.

Joining this community is the first step toward a long-term commitment to growing as a responsible and innovative AI practitioner. (sorry about a few lines of sop from chatgpt!, had a time crunch) :)
